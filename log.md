# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 

### Day 1: June 13, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created simple website to track progress. Forked my second repository and learned how to clone it on my machine. Re-wrote Anki cards for Ruby basics exercises.

**Time Spent**: 7 1/2 hours

**Thoughts:** At first I was frustrated because I felt that I had to go back to review the book/exercises again because I couldn't remember it for pseudo-code. That's important to me because I want to know the fundamentals well enough to not have to look it up constantly.

### Day 2: June 14, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly finished Ruby Anki cards, just need to finish up hashes. Also leveled up in rank on Codewars!

**Time Spent**: 4 hours, 41 minutes

**Thoughts:** Yay! I leveled up on Codewars! I remember a couple weeks ago I couldn't even understand what to do, how to write the code, or what kata meant. Everyday I'm practicing exercises and it's helping to solidify concepts in my head.

### Day 3: June 15, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Went out of town today, didn't get too much done. I did about an hour of reviewing hashes, will look at Anki cards.

**Time Spent**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** It's crazy what one day can do for your memory. Even small bits of reviewing one day can help you later on. I will do more tomorrow since I will be home.



### Day 4: June 16, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't update the log for today but I did review the Anki cards on Arrays. 

**Time Spent**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** You think you know something but once it's in card form and you ask yourself those questions, it's totally different. 


### Day 5: June 17, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Made a few google docs forms on specific things that I especially have trouble with. They are short and to the point, which is better than sifting through notes and cards. Also reviewed pseudo-code and I'm going to practice that more with flowcharts. 

**Time Spent**: 5 hours

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will watch the videos on the calculator, finish up reviewing pseudo-code and flowcharts and just keep practicing exercises. The more I do them everyday, the more familiar I get. I've spent almost everyday now on Codewars and I've been getting more points. I'm noticing that I'm able to remember the simplest methods and that helps my confidence level. 


### Day 8: June 20, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent most of the day fighting with my wifi at home. Ended up waking to a coffee shop. Finishing calculator video and am reviewing bonus features.

**Time Spent**: 2 hours, 45 minutes

**Thoughts:** I ended creating my own repository for 100 days of code to keep it clean and so I could practice creating repos. I forked the original one, which is good practice, but I wanted my own repo. I hope that counts but it's all for me in the end anyway. 

**Notes**: I realized that I skipped a few days of reporting my progress. I did code everyday and I logged my time. It's hard for me to do these things, but that's exactly why I'm doing it. 

### Day 9: June 21, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: I spent today finishing up my review of the calculator bonus features. Also did some review with Anki cards, specifically methods. Also read a few of the LS articles on variable scope, methods, and coding tips. Moved a few more files over to the new repo.

**Time Spent**: 4 hours

**Thoughts:** Need to put in more hours next week, goal is 30 hours. Review on the weekends, and research my pi project. I will do a little assignment on flow charts for the calculators to see if that's something that I would like to do to assist me in solving problems. 

### Day 10: June 22, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Read articles on variable scope and "pass by value" and "pass by reference". Will have to reread and ask for clarification tomorrow, because some parts didn't make sense. 

**Time Spent**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Spent most of the day with a bad headache. Like throbbing pain. Still proud that I managed to read about mutability of objects and scope! I hope this will start to get easier over time because I'm worried and sometimes I can't sleep because I feel like it's just so hard for me to understand sometimes and I wont be competent enough to pass the test.

### Day 10: June 23, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to read on pass by value/reference and mutability of objects. Lot to digest.

**Time Spent**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** I have to take this slowly to understand, I need to reread on multiple days to fully get it. 

### Day 11: June 24, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Went through line by line the mortgage calculator. I had forgotten the meaning of name.strip.empty?, and (num.to_i.to_s == num) so with Ruby Docs and Stack Overflow, I have a much better understanding.

**Time Spent**: 3 hours 45 minutes

**Thoughts:** : Will do more tomorrow.

### Day 12: June 25, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
 * Wrote markdown notes for 3/4 articles on scope, methods, and mutability.
 * Moved over all files from intro_to_programming
 
**Time Spent**: 5 hours

**Thoughts:** Feeling more familiar with ruby mutability and variable scope.
