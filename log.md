# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 

### Day 1: June 13, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created simple website to track progress. Forked my second repository and learned how to clone it on my machine. Re-wrote Anki cards for Ruby basics exercises.

**Time Spent**: 7 1/2 hours

**Thoughts:** At first I was frustrated because I felt that I had to go back to review the book/exercises again because I couldn't remember it for pseudo-code. That's important to me because I want to know the fundamentals well enough to not have to look it up constantly.

### Day 2: June 14, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly finished Ruby Anki cards, just need to finish up hashes. Also leveled up in rank on Codewars!

**Time Spent**: 4 hours, 41 minutes

**Thoughts:** Yay! I leveled up on Codewars! I remember a couple weeks ago I couldn't even understand what to do, how to write the code, or what kata meant. Everyday I'm practicing exercises and it's helping to solidify concepts in my head.

### Day 3: June 15, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Went out of town today, didn't get too much done. I did about an hour of reviewing hashes, will look at Anki cards.

**Time Spent**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** It's crazy what one day can do for your memory. Even small bits of reviewing one day can help you later on. I will do more tomorrow since I will be home.



### Day 4: June 16, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't update the log for today but I did review the Anki cards on Arrays. 

**Time Spent**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** You think you know something but once it's in card form and you ask yourself those questions, it's totally different. 


### Day 5: June 17, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Made a few google docs forms on specific things that I especially have trouble with. They are short and to the point, which is better than sifting through notes and cards. Also reviewed pseudo-code and I'm going to practice that more with flowcharts. 

**Time Spent**: 5 hours

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will watch the videos on the calculator, finish up reviewing pseudo-code and flowcharts and just keep practicing exercises. The more I do them everyday, the more familiar I get. I've spent almost everyday now on Codewars and I've been getting more points. I'm noticing that I'm able to remember the simplest methods and that helps my confidence level.
